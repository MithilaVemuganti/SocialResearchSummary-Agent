# 🧠 Social Research Summary Agent

> An AI-powered agent that generates and evaluates research summaries in domains like climate, education, and social impact using IBM Granite models on Watsonx.ai.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Researchers and students often struggle to keep up with the growing volume of academic content. This agent helps streamline the early stages of academic research by generating simulated summaries and comparing them with real abstracts. It scores AI summaries based on **clarity**, **completeness**, and **coverage** — making it ideal for literature review, academic exploration, or educational feedback.
